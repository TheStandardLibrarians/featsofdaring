# The Manual of Mob

The Manual of Mob provides guidelines for The Standard Librarians. They are working in a group of people with varied experience levels. Mobbing is similar to pairing but with a roomful of people. The Standard Librarians have found this tool incredibly effective. It keeps everyone on the same page and the project keeps moving forward through aggregated knowledge. Mobbing allows for an incredible learning environment where a beginner or a new comer can help make progress on the project from the very first day.

# Values

## **Kindness • Consideration •Respect**

The Standard Librarians are mobbing in a [round robin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin) fashion. Everyone is seated around the room; they physically switch chairs at the end of ten minutes increments of time as recorded by a buzzer. The code is projected on a screen that all can see. The person at the computer is called the Driver. The person to their right is the Navigator. They have established roles and rules to prevent some of the earlier challenges they encountered while mobbing. This document is in flux as they figure out better and more effective ways to work together. 

These are the roles that we have defined and the expectations for each.

# Roles

## Driver

**Learning Goal:** practice keyboarding, listening, and translating commands

 + An intelligent keyboard 
 + Doesn't type unless directed 
 + Has a backseat driver role
 + The driver can say,  "IDK, I need help."
 
## Primary navigator

**Learning Goal:** articulating actions/next steps, solving programming problems

  + Express high-level intent to the driver/keyboardist.  
    ie: say “show all files including the hidden ones” instead of “ls -a”.
  + Helps digest the group's ideas and pass them on to the driver
  + The person to the right of the driver. They get to navigate for fifteen minutes, while the driver is at the keyboard

## Backseat driver
 
**Learning Goal:** learning to listen, absorbing information and being engaged enough to help if the navigator needs assistance. 

 + If the primary navigator doesn’t know what to do next, they can ask the rest of the group
 + Be ready for your turn navigating.

## Rules

1. No reaching in when someone is at their keyboard. If someone reaches in, you yell “Hot Potato”.
3. Keep a learning journal, recap what you learned at the end of the session. 9:15pm
4. Be kind with other people’s equipment, and be gentle with keyboards.
5. Keep regular breaks
6. When people work remotely, Loop them in with audio, video and screen share.
7. Respect the timer, but be flexible about times when someone is finishing something and if there is a big group.
