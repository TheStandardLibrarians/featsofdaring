# Rules
1. Express high-level intent. For example, say “show files” instead of “ls”.
2. No reaching in when someone is at their keyboard. If someone reaches in, you yell “Hot Potato”.
3. Keep a learning journal, recap what you learned at the end of the session.
4. Be kind with other people’s equipment, and be gentle with keyboards.
5. Keep regular breaks
6. When people work remotely, try to loop them in.
7. Respect the timer, but be flexible about times when there is a big group.
