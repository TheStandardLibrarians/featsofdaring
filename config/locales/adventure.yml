        copy: "You just made a call to the web. You used a library from the Ruby Standard library called net/http to place a call on the web. By making the request you discover that the web page moved. 


What does this mean? Let’s break that down a bit... When Cuddy calls Pretty P. he can’t reach her because Pretty P. has moved to Hollywood. 


Just like if you call someone’s phone number who has moved; you would hear a disconnect message from the operator. The web has similar messages. A 301 Error means that the web page has moved. You are often re-directed to a different page without even seeing this error.


To move forward type in the language the cats understand. Type meow."
