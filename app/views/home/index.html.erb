  If you’re new to programming, Ruby is a great introduction. If you’re looking to brush up on your library knowledge, you’re also in the right place. Ruby is flexible, powerful, and easy to read; except for sometimes like in the Standard Library documentation.
  
  The Ruby Standard Library is a set of tools included in the Ruby programming language that are incredibly useful. Many developers and gems use them often. You may have already used the libraries without knowing.
  
  Over the next few adventures, you’ll get to know some of the popular Ruby libraries.  Knowing these can help you program a robot, rig your house to dim the lights, or build a site to sell your homemade (probably poisonous) kombucha.
